# Docker Development Environment

Terra provides a docker development environment that allows developers access to a common environment to develop Terra components regardless of the OS they are developing on.

## Services

In each Terra repository there is a docker-compose.yml file that defines several services, most importantly ```dev```.

### Dev Service

The dev service provides a linux environment with node, npm and the zsh terminal pre-installed. By default the dev service volume mounts the entire local repo directory into the docker container to enable hot reloading during development.

### Standalone Chrome Service

Terra's webdriver.io integration tests must run against selenium standalone-chrome node, so this service is required to run wdio tests. It is started alongside the dev and test-ci services.

## Sharing ```node_modules```

The docker development environment intentionally will write out ```node_modules``` to the shared host volume. This provides several benefits:

* Simpler volume mounting, everything edited in the repo is shared to the docker container.
* Node module caching. For the development containers ```npm install``` is run at run time of the docker container (opposed to build time). This is done to allow ```npm install``` to discover local dependencies. To avoid long startup times ```node_modules``` are cached to the local volume. If ```node_modules``` are found ```npm install``` is not run at run time.

## Before Development

To build all the services in the docker-compose file, run:

```bash
docker-compose build
```

## Developing

To get started developing with the dev service, run:

```bash
docker-compose run --service-ports dev
```

This will start the docker container for the repo, run npm install (if ```node_modules``` are not detected)  and then launch the zsh terminal. Then you're free to use your favorite editor to manipulate the code in the repo. Simply run ```npm run start``` once the terminal has launched to start the server.

## Testing

It is required to use the ```--service-ports``` flag when running either service to run wdio tests from the docker container. This maps the service's ports to the host.

## After development

After you've finished running development (or periodically), run:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

This will stop the standalone-chrome service that will otherwise be left running on your device.

## Using Local Dependencies

Local dependencies are supported in the docker development environment, but require an additional step. For the docker container to be able to find the local dependency, it must be volume mounted to the docker container from the dev service.

For example:

package.json

```json
"dependencies": {
    "classnames": "file:../classnames",
}
```

docker-compose.yml

```diff
dev:
  image: "terra-ui:dev"
  build:
    context: ./
    args:
      - npm_install=false
  ports:
    - 8080:8080
  volumes:
    - .:/opt/module
+    # This is the local dependency volume mount.
+    - ../classnames:/opt/classnames
```

## Other Ways to Run the Zsh Terminal

It is also possible to run the Zsh terminal on a docker container. To attach to a running docker container, run:

```bash
docker exec -it <hash for running docker container> /bin/zsh
```

## Troubleshooting

### Error: Missing binding

This error means that a node_module install for one environment is being run in another. Likely this means that you ran npm install on your host OS and are now trying to use that module in your docker container or the opposite. To resolve the issue delete the ```node_modules``` folder and run npm_install where you are attempting to start the server.

### Dependency changes not taking effect

npm install is triggered at run time of the docker container. If a ```node_modules``` directory is found npm install will not run. If dependencies have changed the script checking for ```node_modules``` isn't smart enough to re-run npm install. To resolve the issue either terminate the service and run npm install or delete the ```node_modules``` folder and rerun the docker container.
