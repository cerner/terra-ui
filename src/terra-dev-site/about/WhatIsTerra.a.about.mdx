## What is Terra?

Terra is Cerner's open-source framework for creating web applications that integrate into the Cerner application ecosystem and meet Cerner's exacting UX design standards. Built on a foundation of [React](https://reactjs.org/), Terra provides the building blocks to construct single-page applications. More than just a component library, Terra offers solutions to common application problems such as internationalization, modal presentation, unsaved changes, loading overlays, and themes.

Terra also offers a reuseable set of configurable React components to help build out applications. Similar to Apple's [appkit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit), Android's [SDK](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui), and Microsoft's [WinUI](https://microsoft.github.io/microsoft-ui-xaml/), these [React components](/components) are designed to be building blocks that are composed into higher-order workflows and components.

Terra is not limited to application building blocks. Terra provides a development and testing environment with [terra-dev-site](/dev_tools/terra-dev-site/terra-dev-site/about) and [terra developer tools](/dev_tools). These tools help you build pieces of your application in isolation with the same webpack asset configuration. Additionally, we provide testing features for unit and functional testing.

Check out the [Getting Started Guide](/guides/terra-ui/installing-components) to install your first Terra component and begin building an application.
