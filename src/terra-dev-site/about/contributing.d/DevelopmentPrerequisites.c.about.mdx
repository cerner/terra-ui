## Repositories

Terra is divided into several projects:
- [terra-application](https://github.com/cerner/terra-application) - A framework to support application development with Terra components.
- [terra-clinical](https://github.com/cerner/terra-clinical) - Contains clinical focused components to help developers quickly build out new applications.
- [terra-core](https://github.com/cerner/terra-core) -  Contains core react components to help developers quickly build out new applications.
- [terra-dev-site](https://github.com/cerner/terra-dev-site) - Common 'dev site' for documenting terra components.
- [terra-framework](https://github.com/cerner/terra-framework) - Contains higher order, opinionated react components to help developers quickly build out new applications.
- [terra-toolkit](https://github.com/cerner/terra-toolkit) - A set of packages providing configuration, as well as testing.

## Development Setup

### Git / GitHub

You must have [git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/) installed on your computer and an account with [Github](https://github.com/).

### Node / NPM

You’ll need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm. (npm will be installed when you install Node.js)

We currently use the 10.x version of node in our projects.

We recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to install and manage node on your machine.

In the project directory you can run `nvm use` to use the specified version of node associated with the project.

If your console tells you that you don’t have that version installed, run `nvm install`

### Docker

[Terra Functional Testing](/dev_tools/cerner/terra-functional-testing/about) uses [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to setup, run, and tear down selenium to ensure a consistent testing environment locally and in continuous integration build systems. To use Terra Functional Testing for webdriver testing, you must install docker on your machine.

Install Docker version 17.09.0 or higher. Installation instructions can be found at [https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).
