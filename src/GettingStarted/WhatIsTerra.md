## What is Terra?
Terra offers a set of configurable React components designed to help build scalable and modular healthcare focused applications. These components follow Cernerâ€™s Design Standard Guidelines and are well-maintained and tested. The UI framework easily integrates with webpack-based workflows and was created to solve real-world issues in projects we work on day to day.

Getting familiar with [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) before getting started with Terra UI is recommended but not required. Terra UI is a set of React components, so understanding how React fits into web development is important. Terra UI components work with React 15.4.2+.
