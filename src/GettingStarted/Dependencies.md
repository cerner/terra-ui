## Dependencies
All Terra UI components have the following peer dependencies:

- [react](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#overview) - Javascript Library for building user interfaces.
- [react-dom](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html#overview) - React package for working with the DOM.
- [terra-base](https://github.com/cerner/terra-core/tree/master/packages/terra-base) - The foundational Terra component that sets minimal global styles and provides internationalization support for an application.

Some components may have additional peer dependencies, and these will be listed in their package.json. If `UNMET PEER DEPENDENCY` errors are shown when installing terra components, then manually install the peer dependencies listed in the console.
