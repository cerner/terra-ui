# Building an Item Collection

`terra-item-collection` was a wrapper component designed to display data as either a table or list of items dependent on the relative container size. It has been deprecated in favor of encouraging teams to create their own component. We found that the item collection was too limited in API to meet the varied needs of all consumers and instead we now recommend teams use terra components to create their own flexible list/table component. This guide is intended to help consumers create their own 'item-collection' to switch between a table and list layout depending on the relative container size.

The `terra-item-collection` used [terra-responsive-element](/components/terra-responsive-element/responsive-element/responsive-element) to swap between it's [terra-table](/components/terra-table/table/table) and [terra-list](/components/terra-list/list/list) displays. The example in this guide use `ActiveBreakpointContext` from [terra-application](/application/terra-application/application) to switch what is displayed based on current browser size.

```javascript
import { ActiveBreakpointContext } from 'terra-application/lib/breakpoints';
...
const CustomItemCollection = () => {
  const activeBreakpoint = React.useContext(ActiveBreakpointContext);
  ...
  switch (activeBreakpoint) {
    case 'tiny':
    case 'small':
    case 'medium':
      return listDisplay;
    case 'large':
    case 'huge':
    case 'enormous':
    default:
      return tableDisplay;
  }
};
```

This will display a list at browser size `medium` and below and a table on larger sizes.

The example also use [terra-clinical-item-view](/components/terra-clinical-item-view/clinical-item-view/clinical-item-view) for each cell of data which is not required. It is used here to to recreate the deprecated `terra-item-collection` but we encourage you to create your own cell layout to meet the requirements of your design..

## Creating the Item Collection

In the following examples we create 2 different components. A [terra-list](/components/terra-list/list/list) display is used when browser size is below 'medium'. The other component is a [terra-table](/components/terra-table/table/table).

### Creating the List

Start with a Terra `List` component and define these two props: `dividerStyles` and `role`. `dividerStyle` is used to determine if and where you want the border-color to be applied to each of the children and can have the values 'none', 'standard', 'bottom-only'. `role` is only used if the children you have in `List` are selectable, and if they are, is defined as 'listbox'.

```javascript
  const listDisplay = (
  <List dividerStyle="none" role="listbox">
    {children}
  </List>);
```

Next we build the children that are going into this `List`. Each child should be dropped in [`terra-list`'s `Item`](/components/terra-list/list/list-item) and be set as the display prop in an [ItemView](/components/terra-clinical-item-view/clinical-item-view/clinical-item-view).

```javascript
  const listChild = (
    <Item>
      <ItemView
        displays={React.Children.toArray(children)}
        ...
      />
    </Item>
  );
```

In our example we use many optional props to better organize and display the mock data we have provided.

### Creating the Table

Using [terra-table](/components/terra-table/table/table), we start with this.

```javascript
  const tableDisplay = (
    <Table
      summaryId="standard-table"
      summary="This table has standard padding"
      numberOfColumns={mockData[0].cells.length}
      dividerStyle="horizontal"
      rowStyle="disclose"
      bodyData={[
        {
          rows: React.Children.toArray(createRows(mockData)),
        },
      ]}
      className={cx('table')}
    />
  );
```

`summaryId` is an element-id for the component, `summary` is just a brief text to describe the table's content, and `className` is a scope class name tp add CSS. `numberOfColumns` is also pretty self-explanatory as how many columns you will need in the table. `dividerStyle` is used to put divisions between rows.

`rowStyle` we define as 'disclose' because in our example our rows are selectable to then disclose further information upon selection.

In our particular example, we created a mock data object we parse through to create the rows and cells. The `createRows` function which looks like this.

```javascript
const createRows = rowData => (
  {
    key: rowData.key,
    isStriped: rowData.isStriped,
    cells: createCellsForRow(rowData.cells),
    discloseAction: {
      metaData: { key: rowData.key },
      discloseLabel: rowData.discloseText,
      isDisclosed: selectedKey === rowData.key,
      discloseCellIndex: 0,
      onDisclose: handleRowDisclose,
    },
  }
);
```

Each row needs a `key` which is a unique identifier, in our example it is 'row-0', 'row-1', etc. `isStriped` is set to 'true' every other row to give a close appearance to past item-collection.

`discloseAction` is a special object for use when we select that row. `metaData` just contains a key for that row and `discloseLabel` is just a brief description the row such as 'Power Row 0 - Details'. `isDisclosed` is 'true' only when our component's state matches with the metadata key. `discloseCellIndex` is the index of the cell that provides the accessible link entry point.

`onDisclose` is a simple state update function as seen here.

```javascript
const handleRowDisclose = (event, metaData) => {
  event.preventDefault();
  if (selectedKey !== metaData.key) {
    setSelectedKey(metaData.key);
  }
};
```

For creating cells in each row we do this

```javascript
const createCellsForRow = cells => cells.map(cell => createCell(cell));
const createCell = cell => ({ key: cell.key, children: cell.children, attrs: cell.attrs });
```

Cells are simple and just require a key, the children of said cell and then we use `attrs` to set `className` in our example like so.

```javascript
const attrs = { className: cx('content-display')};
```
