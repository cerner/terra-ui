# Entrance Criteria

## UX Approval

Terra requires the approval of Cerner's UX design team for both component enhancements and new components added to our library. This team ensures general UX consistency of the Terra component library. To start the contribution process, be sure to log an issue for the UX team to review.

## Reusability

As Terra is a multi-concept UX library, all the components that are contained therein must be broadly reusable. Thus, Terra excludes the inclusion of niche components with a small amount of reuse.

## Meets Existing Standards

Any contributed terra component *must* adhear to Terra's component standards.  This includes:

* Accessibility
* Browser Support
* Theme Support
* Internationalization Support
* RTL Support
* Jest and WDIO Test Coverage

For more detailed standards, check out the [standards page](/contributing/terra-ui/component-standards).

## Proprietary Concerns

Terra is open source. Thus, components cannot not depend on internal Cerner intellectual property.
