# General Guidelines

Keep these things in mind when developing with Terra components:

* Terra components are black boxes. You should not rely on internal implementation specifics. This includes DOM structure, classes, and undocumented side effects.
* Try and keep your DOMs small. If you have a list that could have thousands of items in it, you might need to rethink your design
* Take some time to learn the basics of JavaScript and React
* Pay attention to your dependencies. Dependencies that are only used in development should be dev dependencies. Make sure all peer dependencies are met.
