## What is Terra?

Terra UI offers a set of configurable [React components](https://engineering.cerner.com/terra-ui/#/components) designed to help build scalable and modular healthcare focused applications. The User Interface (UI) framework has been developed to work with Webpack and was created to solve real-world issues in projects we work on in the Healthcare IT space. Along with building out a UI component library, we've built out tooling to help with [testing](https://github.com/cerner/terra-toolkit), [development](https://github.com/cerner/terra-dev-site), and [managing translations](https://github.com/cerner/terra-aggregate-translations) when building React application.

It is highly recommended to become familiar with [React](https://reactjs.org/) before using Terra UI, but it is not required. Since Terra UI is a set of React components, it is important to understand how React fits into web development. Terra UI components work with React v16.8.5+.

Check out the [Getting Started Guide](https://engineering.cerner.com/terra-ui/getting-started/terra-ui/installing-components) to install you first Terra component and begin building an application.
