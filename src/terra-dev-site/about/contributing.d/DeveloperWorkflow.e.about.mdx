## Create Tech Design
It's good to create a tech design on the related GitHub issue you'll be working on. This allows for discussion with the [terra team](https://github.com/orgs/cerner/teams/terra) before getting deep into development. Once you feel the tech design has been landed on, feel free to open up a pull request. Based on the changes introduced in the PR, the change will either be considered a small or large change and follow review guidelines documented in the [terra governance modal](/about/terra-ui/governance-model).

Incorporate feedback you receive from tech design review into your implementation. It's helpful to update the tech design with feedback you incorporate.

## Tech Design Format

```
# Tech Design
## Expected behavior
/* Describe expected behavior, include visuals if helpful */

## Code Sample
/* Describe proposed code change at high-level */

/* Include sample code if applicable */

## Props
/* Describe react props */

| Prop Name | Type | Is Required | Default Value | Description |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| text |string | required | none | Sets the button text. |
| href |string | optional | none | Sets the href. When set will render the component as an anchor tag. |

## Responsiveness
/* Describe intended responsive behavior if applicable */

## Internationalization
/* Describe intended internationalization behavior if applicable */

## Accessibility
/* Describe intended accessible behavior if applicable */
```

## Starting Development
The following guide covers the development workflow for the terra monorepos that are managed with [Lerna](https://lernajs.io/) to handle shared and cross-package dependencies.

* [terra-core](https://github.com/cerner/terra-core)
* [terra-framework](https://github.com/cerner/terra-framework)
* [terra-clinical](https://github.com/cerner/terra-clinical)

Components, along with their docs and tests are organized as individual packages that share similar tooling. You can read more about the [directory structure of these components here](https://github.com/cerner/generator-terra-module#generated-package).

## Install Dependencies

After you’ve gone through the [git workflow](/about/terra-ui/contributing/git-workflow) and created your branch, the next step will be to install the project dependencies.

Run the following command:

`npm install`

This will do the following:
* Install dependencies and hoist shared dependencies
* Symlink together all Lerna packages that are dependencies
* Compile JSX in `src` to `lib` directories
* Copy SCSS files in `src` to `lib` directories

Note that if you switch between branches, dependencies may be different between them. We recommend running `npm run clean:install` when switching between branches. This clears all `node_modules` directories and runs `npm install`

## Starting The Development Server

Running `npm start` will start up the development server. It will be available at [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)

You can navigate to different component documentation pages. These pages are auto-generated via files in the  [terra-dev-site](https://github.com/cerner/terra-dev-site) doc directories found in each package directory.

## Starting The Development Server For Internet Explorer 10

The version of [webpack-serve](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/webpack-serve) we use for the local development site is not compatible with IE 10. To handle this, there is a `start-static` script that can be run that will start up a static dev server that works in IE 10.

`npm run start-static`

_Note that this static server does not support hot reloading, if you want to see changes based on your code updates, you will need to restart the server after you've made changes to see the updates._

## Follow Component Standards
As you work on your code changes, ensure the components follow [the Terra component standards](/about/terra-ui/component-standards).

## Running Lint Scripts
For Terra projects, we’ve created our own [ESLint config](https://github.com/cerner/eslint-config-terra) and [Stylelint config](https://github.com/cerner/stylelint-config-terra).

* Our ESLint config is based on [Airbnb’s JavaScript style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).
* Our Stylelint config is based on [sass-guidelin.es](https://sass-guidelin.es/).

Run the following command in the root directory to run both ESLint and Stylelint for all packages.

`npm run lint`

* You can also run `npm run lint:js` to only run ESLint for all packages.
* You can also run `npm run lint:scss` to only run StyleLint for all packages.

You can also run these scripts in the individual package directories.

Change directories to the specific package in your terminal, e.g. `cd packages/terra-button`, and run the same lint commands for ESLint and Stylelint.

```
npm run lint
npm run lint:js
npm run lint:scss
```

We recommend that you install a plugin to your editor to run [ESLint](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/integrations#editors) and [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/user-guide/complementary-tools/#editor-plugins) automatically when you type, which will then show you any errors inline.

## Running Jest Tests

We use [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for testing, including unit tests and snapshot testing for components.

Run the following command in the root directory to run Jest for all packages.

`npm run jest`

You can also run Jest in the individual package directories.

Change directories to the specific package in your terminal, e.g. `cd packages/terra-button`, and run the following command

`npm run test:jest`

If you make intentional changes to an existing component, you will need to update its snapshot:

`npm run test:jest -- -u`

## Running Webdriver.io (WDIO) Tests

We use Webdriver.io for browser testing functionality, visual regression testing, and accessibility testing.

Run the following command in the root directory to run Webdriver.io for all packages.

`npm run wdio`

You can also run Webdriver.io in the individual package directories.

Change directories to the specific package in your terminal, e.g. `cd packages/terra-button`, and run the following command

`npm run test:wdio`

More info on writing webdriver.io tests for terra can be [found here](https://github.com/cerner/terra-toolkit-boneyard/blob/main/docs/Wdio_Utility.md).

_If you make changes to code inside of the `src` directories, and you do not see if reflected in tests, run `npm run compile` to ensure your tests are using the latest code changes._

### A Note On Testing

Note that the test suite needs to pass for your changes to be accepted, so it's worth running this locally during development and before committing.

Even though we'd like to automate as much as possible, a comprehensive manual test is never a bad idea, especially if you're working in an area of the codebase that's particularly business critical. Reviewers are also encouraged to put UI changes through their paces, to act as a last line of defense before merging.

## Updating The Changelog

Once you're done with development, you'll need to document your changes in the component's `CHANGELOG.md` file. We follow [https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) for our changelog format. In the changelog, at the top under the "Unreleased" section, add a section for the type of change you've made.

Types of changelog sections:
* `Added` - for new features.
* `Changed` - for changes in existing functionality.
* `Deprecated` - for soon-to-be removed features.
* `Removed` - for now removed features.
* `Fixed` - for any bug fixes.
* `Security` - in case of vulnerabilities.

Then add entries for the changes made in your branch under this section.

## Submitting A Pull Request

Check out the [git workflow](/about/terra-ui/contributing/git-workflow) to follow the steps for submitting a pull request after your development is ready for review. From there, you'll follow the git workflow until the pull request is merged.
