# Creating An Item Collection

An Item Collection is a wrapper component designed to display data as either a table or list of items dependent on the relative container size.

The `terra-item-collection` used [terra-responsive-element](/components/terra-responsive-element/responsive-element/responsive-element) to swap between it's [terra-table](/components/terra-table/table/table) and [terra-list](/components/terra-list/list/list) displays. The examples in this guide use `ActiveBreakpointContext` from [terra-application](/application/terra-application/application) to switch what is displayed based on current browser size.

```javascript
import { ActiveBreakpointContext } from 'terra-application/lib/breakpoints';
...
const CustomItemCollection = () => {
  const activeBreakpoint = React.useContext(ActiveBreakpointContext);
  ...
  switch (activeBreakpoint) {
    case 'tiny':
    case 'small':
    case 'medium':
      return listDisplay;
    case 'large':
    case 'huge':
    case 'enormous':
    default:
      return tableDisplay;
  }
};
```

This will display our list display at browser size `medium` and below and our table display on larger sizes.

The examples also use [terra-clinical-item-view](/components/terra-clinical-item-view/clinical-item-view/clinical-item-view) for each cell of data which is not necessary and is used to to recreate the deprecated `terra-item-collection`.

## Replicating the Deprecated Terra Clinical Item Collection displays

### Creating the List version

Start with a Terra `List` component and define these two props: `dividerStyles` and `role`. `dividerStyle` is used to determine if and where you want the border-color to be applied to each of the children and can have the values 'none', 'standard', 'bottom-only'. `role` is only used if the children you have in `List` are selectable, and if they are, is defined as 'listbox'.

```javascript
  const listDisplay = (
  <List dividerStyle="none" role="listbox">
    {children}
  </List>);
```

Next we build the children that are going into this `<List>`. Each child should be wrapped in `terra-list`'s `<Item>` and as display in an `<ItemView>` from `terra-clinical-item-view`.

```javascript
  var listChild = (
    <Item>
      <ItemView
        displays={React.Children.toArray(children)}
      />
    </Item>
  );
```

## Creating Single Selectable Table version

For `tableDisplay`, we start with this.

```javascript
  const tableDisplay = (
    <Table
      summaryId="standard-table"
      summary="This table has standard padding"
      numberOfColumns={mockData[0].cells.length}
      dividerStyle="horizontal"
      rowStyle="disclose"
      bodyData={[
        {
          rows: createRows(mockData),
        },
      ]}
      className={cx('table')}
    />
  );
```

`summaryId` is an element-id for the component, `summary` is just a brief text to describe the table's content, and `className` is just add some CSS. `numberOfColumns` is also pretty self-explanatory as how many columns you will need in the table. `dividerStyle` is used to put divisions between rows.

`rowStyle` we define as 'disclose' because in our example our rows are selectable to then disclose further information upon selection.

In our particular example, we created a mock data object we parse through to create the rows and cells. The `createRows` function which looks like this.

```javascript
const createRow = rowData => (
  {
    key: rowData.key,
    isStriped: rowData.isStriped,
    cells: createCellsForRow(rowData.cells),
    discloseAction: {
      metaData: { key: rowData.key },
      discloseLabel: rowData.discloseText,
      isDisclosed: selectedKey === rowData.key,
      discloseCellIndex: 0,
      onDisclose: handleRowDisclose,
    },
  }
);
```

Each row needs a `key` which is a unique identifier, in our example it is 'row-0', 'row-1', etc. `isStriped` is set to 'true' every other row to give a close appearance to past item-collection.

`discloseAction` is a special object for use when we select that row. `metaData` just contains a key for that row and `discloseLabel` is just a brief description the row such as 'Power Row 0 - Details'. `isDisclosed` is 'true' only when our component's state matches with the metadata key. `discloseCellIndex` is the index of the cell that provides the accessible link entry point.

`onDisclose` is a simple state update function as seen here.

```javascript
const handleRowDisclose = (event, metaData) => {
  event.preventDefault();
  if (selectedKey !== metaData.key) {
    setSelectedKey(metaData.key);
  }
};
```

For creating cells in each row we do this

```javascript
const createCellsForRow = cells => cells.map(cell => createCell(cell));
const createCell = cell => ({ key: cell.key, children: cell.children, attrs: cell.attrs });
```

Cells are simple and just require a key, the children of said cell and then we use `attrs` to set `className` in our example like so.

```javascript
const attrs = { className: cx('content-display')};
```

## Creating a Cell Grid that looks like a Table

Instead of using `<Table>`, you can use [CellGrid](/components/terra-cell-grid/cell-grid/cell-grid) to create another version of the default content when over a certain window size. This method requires a little bit of CSS to be put in place to get a closer match to `<Table>`'s default style. The basic content look of it looks like this.

```javascript
  const cellGridDisplay = (
    <div className={cx('cellgrid-wrapper')}>
      <CellGrid className={cx('row')}>
        <Cell className={cx('start-accessory')} key="cell-0" width={{ static: { value: 40, unit: 'px' } }}>{startAccessory}</Cell>
        <Cell className={cx('display')} key="cell-i" width={{ scalar: 1 }}>{display}</Cell>
        ...
      </CellGrid>
      ...
    </div>
  );
```

In this example, the `<CellGrid>` effectively act as rows and doesn't require any props other than defining a class for it. The `<Cell>`'s are where the content is placed. In the example provided at the bottom of this page, the content has two accessories on either side of the main information. Setting these accessories `width` prop to `{ static: { value: 40, unit: 'px' } }` allows the accessories to only take up a small amount of space, while the rest of the `Cell`'s use `{ scalar: 1 }` for width to automatically take up an equal percentage of the remaining space.

For the main styles it uses the following CSS.

```css
.cellgrid-wrapper {
  border-bottom: 1px solid #c8cacb;
}

.row {
  border-top: 1px solid #c8cacb;
  display: flex;
  min-height: 60px;
}

.row:nth-child(even) {
  background: #f4f4f4;
}
```

## Creating a read-only example using HTML table

If you are making a read-only table, we suggest using [HTML Table](/components/terra-html-table/html-table/table) which gets put together like this.

```javascript
const htmlTable = (
  <Table>
    <Header>
      <HeaderCell key="cell-date">{"Date"}</HeaderCell>
      <HeaderCell key="cell-1">{"Chrome"}</HeaderCell>
      ...
    </Header>
    <Body>
      <Row key="row_0">
        <Cell key="display_0" className={cx('cell-date')}>{"October 2019"}</Cell>
        <Cell key="display_1" className={cx('cell')}>{"68.91%"}</Cell>
        ...
      </Row>
      ...
    </Body>
  </Table>
);
```

It uses a straightforward Header and Body section. The header section is composed of `<HeaderCell>`'s which just needs a simple key and child for its display.

The body `<Row>`s and `<Cell>`s are also for the most part easily constructed with keys required for both. The `<Cell>`s also get classes for ease of styling and children for actual content.
