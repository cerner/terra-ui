## Installing Components

<div className="tui-illustration-grid">
<div className="tui-illustration-grid-col">

The first Terra packages that you will want to install are [terra-application](/application/terra-application).

If you are using npm, run the following command:

```bash
$ npm install terra-application --save
```

terra-application is required to use any other terra component.

After it is installed and set up, you can install individual Terra components as needed. Each terra component is a separate NPM package. All of the terra packages can be found on the [public npm repository](https://www.npmjs.com/browse/keyword/Terra). To install the Terra NPM package, run a command like:

```bash
$ npm install terra-button --save
```

This will install the terra-button component package as a dependency in the projectâ€™s package.json file. Each component page includes similar documentation on how to install the component, as well as includes a basic example of how to use it.

## Dependencies

<div className="tui-illustration-grid">
<div className="tui-illustration-grid-col">

All Terra components have the following peer dependencies:

- [react](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#overview) - Javascript Library for building user interfaces.
- [react-dom](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html#overview) - React package for working with the DOM.

Some components may have additional peer dependencies, and these will be listed in their package.json. If `UNMET PEER DEPENDENCY` errors are shown when installing terra components, you will need to manually install the peer dependencies listed in the console.
