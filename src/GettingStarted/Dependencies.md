## Dependencies
All Terra UI components have the following peer dependencies:

- [react](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#overview) - Javascript Library for building user interfaces.
- [react-dom](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html#overview) - React package for working with the DOM.

Some components may have additional peer dependencies and these will be listed in their package.json. If `UNMET PEER DEPENDENCY` errors are shown when installing terra components, then manually install the peer dependencies listed in the console.
