## Installing Components

Each terra component is a separate NPM package. All of the terra packages can be found on the [public npm repository](https://www.npmjs.com/browse/keyword/Terra). To install the Terra NPM package, run a command like:

```bash
$ npm install terra-button --save
```

This will install the terra-button component package as a dependency in the projectâ€™s package.json file. Each component page includes similar documentation on how to install the component, as well as includes a basic example of how to use it.
