# Contribution Guidelines

We love contributions to Terra. To ensure everyone has a good experience contributing we require the following guidelines. If you are new to open source, be sure to check out [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github)

If you decide to fix an issue, please be sure to check the comment thread in case somebody is already working on a fix. If nobody is working on it at the moment, please leave a comment stating that you intend to work on it so other people don’t accidentally duplicate your effort.
If somebody claims an issue, but doesn’t follow up for more than two weeks, it’s fine to take over it but you should still leave a comment.

All contributions should follow our [conventions](/about/terra-ui/contributing/conventions) and [standards](/about/terra-ui/component-standards).

If you are unsure on if a contribution would be classified as small or large, leave a comment on the issue and we will let you know!

## Small contributions

For small contributions no additional steps are need. Just opening a PR is generally good enough.

### Examples
- Bug fixes
- Variants on components
- Documentation updates
- Increasing test coverage

## Large

For larger contributions the Terra team needs to be consulted and included in the design and scope of the contribution.

### Examples
- A new component
- Non-passive public api changes
- Changing the testing framework
- Major dependency version bumps

### Contributor Expectations

To ensure there are no surprises on PRs and the resulting component, contributors are expected to have regular syncs with the allocated UX and Terra Engineers. This can include periodic meetings and/or attending scrum.

### Tech design

Before any other steps a contributor must provide a brief tech design outlining proposed prop APIs, responsive and accessibly considerations. This must be attached to the github issue.

### Contribution Kickoff

A contribution kickoff with Terra members representing User Experience and Engineering, and the contributing team or individual will be held. The goals of this meeting are to:

- Determine scope of the contribution
- Allocate UX personnel
- Allocate Terra engineering personnel
- Establish general timelines for all parties

### Allocated UX Support and Design

UX must be involved from the beginning of the contribution. It is expected that UX will provide guidance on:

- All themes
- Accessibility
- Design standards

### Allocated Terra Engineering Support

A Terra engineer must be allocated to help guide the contribution. How much of the engineers allocated capacity will be based on the size and complexity of the contribution. The assigned engineer is responsible for:

- General technical guidance
- Ensuring the PR moves through all reviews in a timely manner
- Translation requests

## Long Term Maintenance

After the contribution is merged into main, Terra will take on ownership of the contribution.  This ownership will include:

- Support
- Releases
- Enhancements
