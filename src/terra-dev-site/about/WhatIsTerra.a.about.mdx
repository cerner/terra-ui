## What is Terra?

Terra is Cerner's open-source platform for creating web applications integrating into the Cerner application ecosystem. Built on a foundation of [React](https://reactjs.org/), Terra provides the building blocks to construct accessible single-page applications. More than just a component library, Terra offers solutions to common application problems such as internationalization, modal presentation, unsaved changes, loading overlays, and themes.

Terra also offers a reuseable set of configurable React components to help build out applications. Similar to Apple's [appkit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit), these [React components](/components) are designed to be building blocks that are composed into higher-order workflows and components to represent your concepts. Terra components are built to be accessible and meet Cerners exacting UX design standards.

Terra is not limited to application building blocks. Terra provides a development and testing environment with [terra-dev-site](https://github.com/cerner/terra-dev-site) and [terra-toolkit](https://github.com/cerner/terra-toolkit). These tools help you build pieces of your application pieces in isolation with the same webpack asset configuration. Additionally, the toolkit provides testing features for unit and functional testing, including accessibility testing.

Check out the [Getting Started Guide](/guides/terra-ui/installing-components) to install your first Terra component and begin building an application.
