## What is Terra?
Terra offers a set of configurable React components designed to help build scalable and modular healthcare focused applications. These components follow Cernerâ€™s Design Standard Guidelines and are actively maintained and tested. The User Interface (UI) framework easily integrates with webpack-based workflows and was created to solve real-world issues in projects we work on day to day.

It is highly recommended to become familiar with [React](https://reactjs.org/) before using Terra UI, but it is not required. Since Terra UI is a set of React components, it is important to understand how React fits into web development. Terra UI components work with React v16.2.0+.
