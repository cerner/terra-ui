# Terra Clinical Item Collection

<Notice variant="deprecation" ariaLevel="3">

  This component has been deprecated in favor of encouraging teams to create their own component. We found that the item collection API was too limited to meet the varied needs of all consumers. Instead, we now recommend teams use terra components to create their own flexible list/table component. Please refer to the [Recreating Item Collection Guide](/guides/terra-ui/component-guides/recreating-item-collection) for replacement recommendations.
