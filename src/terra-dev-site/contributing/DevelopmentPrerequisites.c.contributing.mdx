## Development Setup

### Git / GitHub

You must have [git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/) installed on your computer and an account with [Github](https://github.com/).

### Node / NPM

You’ll need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm. (npm will be installed when you install Node.js)

We currently use the 10.x version of node in our projects.

We recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to install and manage node on your machine.

In the project directory you can run `nvm use` to use the specified version of node associated with the project.

If your console tells you that you don’t have that version installed, run `nvm install`

### Docker

[Terra Toolkit](https://github.com/cerner/terra-toolkit) uses [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to setup, run, and tear down selenium to ensure a consistent testing environment locally and in continuous integration build systems. To use Terra Toolkit for webdriver testing, you must install docker on your machine.

Install Docker version 17.09.0 or higher. Installation instructions can be found at [https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).
