## When will X issue be fixed?
As a widely used framework our first concern is quality, all changes to terra must meet our standards before we release them. That said there are a few indicators to help you predict when a change could be available.

1. Does the issue have linked pull request?
  * Most pull requests are completed within 1 to 2 weeks of being issued and released within a week.
2. Second, check for your issue on our [project board](https://github.com/orgs/cerner/projects/1)
  * If the issue is there it means it’s currently being worked on and you can follow the progress.
3. If the issue is neither out for pull request or in process, it’s been prioritized below other issues
  * To express interest in the issue add a comment to the issue and if there is enough interests we may prioritize the issue higher.
